# Decentralized Charging Management Flow Initial

This directory contained the first  decentralized  charging management implementation. This fila has 2 different kinds of subdirectories:

* Data bases of EV characterization from Monte Carlo Simulation. (PCarBusResults...)
* Results from power flow optimization per scenario (Sc...)

This information allows centralized managers to commit the energy traded in energy market by Electric Vehicle Aggregators. The scenarios 1 and 2 didn't present not serve energy participation in power flow performance.

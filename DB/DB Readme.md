# Data Base Presentation
The present Data Base represents the minimum information data required for verification (under research team consideration). This is shown as practical application based in the next case.

A distribution Network Operator (From now on DNO) is  in charge of power system planning (based mainly in its [IEEE 14 bus power system transmission network](.//Power%20System%20Data/)).

In order to achieve this aim the DNO proyected 3 scenarios of electric vehicle adoption for the medium time horizont.
* Scenario 1: Pessimist adoption (0.08 Market participation: 2000 EVs proyected).
* Scenario 2: Normal adoption (0.1 Market participation: 2500 EVs proyected).
* Scenario 3: Optimist adoption (0.15 Market participation: 3750 EVs proyected).

Based in academic advances DNO projected a first option which require investments in distribution network generation (As seen in [1](https://ingenius.ups.edu.ec/index.php/ingenius/article/view/7272)
